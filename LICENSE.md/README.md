Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

This data consists of 180 observations and 88 columns consisting of mean data for Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration),the estimated body acceleration,Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope, each variable for all 6 activities which makes it a total of 30*6 = 180 observations

Raw data that was given:

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector
- 'features.txt': List of all features
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels

Final tidy data (transformed data):

- 'finaldata.txt': combined test and training data with all the averaged values for Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration),the estimated body acceleration,Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope
